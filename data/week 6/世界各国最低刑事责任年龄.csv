A child older than seven but younger than 14 can only be held criminally responsible where it is proved that he or she has the capacity to form the intention necessary to commit an offence or, where negligence is an element of the relevant offence, where he or she has the capacity to behave in the way that a reasonable adult would have behave in the circumstance [Criminal Code, Sections 6 and 7]. Males under the age of 12 are presumed to be incapable of sexual intercourse, though this is a rebuttable presumption and a younger boy can be prosecuted for sexual offences related to sexual intercourse where it can be demonstrated that he was capable of performing the act on the balance of probabilities [Criminal Code, Sections 63].",记录数,1,-19.098,30.047

Somalia,"Somalia's legal system is divided between that of Somaliland, which unilaterally declared its independence in 1991, and the rest of the country. This legal divide has a marked effect on sentencing provisions for child offenders, so the two regions are treated separately.
South / Central Somalia and Puntland

In South/Central Somalia and in Puntland, the Somali Penal Code 1962 sets the minimum age of criminal responsibility at 14 and provides for reduced punishments for persons aged 14 to 17, but it also authorises sending children under 14 to reformatories. The Juvenile Courts and Reformatories Law 1970 defines a child as under 14 and a young person as 14 to 17. It states that a juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine cases relating to children and young people in relation to any offence except murder and repeals inconsistent laws [Penal Code.]. However, it is possible that this law has never been brought into force, and a new juvenile justice law is reportedly being drafted in Puntland [see http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/res.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-7VJAVD, accessed 21 February 2011].

In Somaliland, the Juvenile Justice Law 2007 puts the age of criminal responsibility at 15 and harmonises the provisions of secular, Sharia and customary laws [Reported at http://www.unicef.org/somalia/reallives_5434.html, accessed 21 February 2011].

However, the Law has not been fully implemented and much of the work of the lower courts in criminal justice matters, especially involving children, has until very recently been carried out by regional security committees. During the 1980s, sentences handed down by these committees included life imprisonment and the death penalty, though more recently they appear to have been less draconian. Claims that the committees are lawful under the Public Order Law 1963 are disputed, as is the extent to which that law is still in force.

Somalia,"Somalia's legal system is divided between that of Somaliland, which unilaterally declared its independence in 1991, and the rest of the country. This legal divide has a marked effect on sentencing provisions for child offenders, so the two regions are treated separately.
South / Central Somalia and Puntland

In South/Central Somalia and in Puntland, the Somali Penal Code 1962 sets the minimum age of criminal responsibility at 14 and provides for reduced punishments for persons aged 14 to 17, but it also authorises sending children under 14 to reformatories. The Juvenile Courts and Reformatories Law 1970 defines a child as under 14 and a young person as 14 to 17. It states that a juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine cases relating to children and young people in relation to any offence except murder and repeals inconsistent laws [Penal Code.].

The Criminal Procedure Act 1945 defines an infant as under seven, a child as under 14, a young person as aged 14-16, a juvenile offender as under 17 and an adult as aged 17 and over. In the northern states, the Penal Code 1960 specifies that seven is the minimum age of criminal responsibility and categorises juvenile offenders as those under 17. According to the Sharia laws, children are eligible for hadd (for which the prescribed punishment is mandatory) and qisas (punished by retaliation) punishments from the age of puberty.
